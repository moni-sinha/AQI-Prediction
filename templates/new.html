    <ul class="mt-2 text-xl leading-8">
        Why is ozone a problem?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Ozone can cause a number of health problems, including
    coughing, breathing difficulty, and lung damage.
    Exposure to ozone can make the lungs more susceptible
    to infection, aggravate lung diseases, increase the
    frequency of asthma attacks, and increase the risk of early
    death from heart or lung disease.

        Do I need to be concerned?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Even healthy adults can experience ozone’s harmful
    effects, but some people may be at greater risk. They
    include:<br>
    •	 People with lung disease such as asthma<br>
    •	 Children, including teenagers, because their lungs
    are still developing and they breathe more air per
    pound of body weight than adults<br>
    •	 Older adults<br>
    •	 People who are active outdoors, including outdoor
    workers<br>

        Can I help reduce ozone?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Yes! Here are a few tips.<br>
    •	 Turn off lights you are not using<br>
    •	 Drive less: carpool, use public transportation, bike
    or walk<br>
    •	 Keep your engine tuned, and don’t let your
    engine idle<br>
    •	 When refueling: stop when the pump shuts off,
    avoid spilling fuel, and tighten your gas cap<br>
    •	 Inflate tires to the recommended pressure<br>
    •	 Use low-VOC paint and cleaning products, and seal
    and store them so they can’t evaporate<br>
    •	 Watch for Air Quality Action Days in your area<br>

<h3 class="mt-6 text-3xl leading-8 font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Air quality Guide for Particle Pollution</h3>
</div>

<div style="margin: 15px;">
    <ul class="mt-2 text-xl leading-8">
        Why is particle pollution a problem?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Particle pollution is linked to a number of health
    problems, including coughing, wheezing, reduced
    lung function, asthma attacks, heart attacks and
    strokes. It also is linked to early death.

        Do I need to be concerned?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        While it’s always smart to pay attention to air quality
    where you live, some people may be at greater risk
    from particle pollution. They include:<br>
    •	 People with cardiovascular disease (diseases of
    the heart and blood vessels)<br>
    •	 People with lung disease, including asthma
    and COPD<br>
    •	 Children and teenagers<br>
    •	 Older adults<br>
    •	 Research indicates that obesity or diabetes may
    increase risk.<br>
    •	 New or expectant mothers may also want to take
    precautions to protect the health of their babies.<br>

        Yes! Here are a few tips.<br>
    •	 Drive less: carpool, use public transportation, bike
    or walk<br>
    •	 Choose ENERGY STAR appliances<br>
    •	 Set thermostats higher in summer and lower
    in winter<br>
    •	 Don’t burn leaves, garbage, plastic or rubber<br>
    •	 Keep car, boat and other engines tuned <br>

<h3 class="mt-6 text-3xl leading-8 font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Air Quality and Outdoor Activity Guidance for Schools</h3>
</div>

<div style="margin: 15px;">
    <ul class="mt-2 text-xl leading-8">
        How long can students stay outside when the air quality is unhealthy?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        There is no exact amount of time. The worse the air quality, the more important it is to take breaks, do less intense
    activities, and watch for symptoms. Remember that students with asthma will be more sensitive to unhealthy air. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <ul class="mt-2 text-xl leading-8">
        What physical activities can students do inside?
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Encourage indoor activities that keep all students moving. Plan activities that include aerobic exercise as well as
    muscle and bone strengthening components (e.g., jumping, skipping, sit-ups, pushups). If a gymnasium or open space
    is accessible, promote activities that use equipment, such as cones, hula hoops, and sports balls. If restricted to the
    classroom, encourage students to come up with fun ways to get everyone moving (e.g., act out action words from a
    story). Teachers and recess supervisors can work with PE teachers to identify additional indoor activities.
